# Neural Network Classification
Classification problem involves predicting whether something is one thing or another. 
- Binary classification: involves only two options
- Multiclass classification: more than two options e.g a food or a dog or a car
- Multilabel classification: what category should an element be labeled as: e.g what type of genre should a song be classified as?

 For this project, Ill be using two different data sets to work on binary and multiclass problems
